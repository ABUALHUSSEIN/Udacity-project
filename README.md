## 📌 Overview

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to **predict housing prices** using various real estate features. The dataset is cleaned, analyzed, and modeled through a full end-to-end data science pipeline—from EDA to model evaluation.

> 🎯 **Goal**: Build a robust regression model to accurately estimate house prices and extract business insights from the data.

---

## 🚀 Highlights

- ✅ **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, categorical encoding, and outliers.
- 📊 **EDA**: Visualized key relationships using plots and heatmaps.
- 🤖 **Modeling**: Trained and compared models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- 🧪 **Evaluation**: Used RMSE, and R²  for model assessment.
